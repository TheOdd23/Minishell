# minishell

The goal of minishell is exactly like the name says, recreating a minimalistic shell (in teams of 2).

We had to implement redirections <, <<, > and >> and pipes | , 7 builtins(echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env and exit), handle environment variables, single and double quotes and many more things.

Like the real shell, our program needed to react accordingly to signals such as ctrl-d and ctrl-c.

The hardest part of the project was not the projkect in itself, but mostly knowing when to stop adding stuff, when it was ok if it was different than the original, how to handle certain situations, etc.

This is one of the project I'm most proud of since it wasn't an easy task. Always comparing your project with bash makes you do additional stuff you weren't supposed to do, but I'm glad I still did them, cause it showed me I could.
